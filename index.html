                <h3 class="red">Scientific Name:</h3>
                <p>"Cyprinus rubroflores" is a made-up Latin-style scientific name that I created. It combines elements of the real scientific name of koi fish, Cyprinus rubrofuscus with "rubro", meaning "red" in Latin and "flores", meaning "flower". This name reflects the koi's connection to lotus flowers.</p>

                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Tang Dynasty, first documented in classical Chinese paintings and poetry.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Koi fish primarily inhabit serene ponds, lakes, and garden water features, often seen alongside lotus flowers, moss-covered stones, and traditional bridges. In Asian cultures, they symbolize good fortune, prosperity, and longevity and are commonly found in temple ponds, ornamental gardens, and private courtyards.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Koi fish have sleek, elongated bodies with shimmering, vibrant scales. Their colors range from red, white, black, gold, orange, to blue, often forming intricate patterns. Their scales have a metallic sheen, making them appear as if they are gliding through the water like living jewels.</p>

                Koi fish have been revered in East Asian culture for centuries, originating from wild carp that were domesticated and selectively bred in China before becoming highly prized in Japan. Their presence in ponds is believed to attract good fortune and positive energy, while their association with lotus flowers represents purity, resilience, and spiritual growth.
                According to legend, a koi that successfully swims upstream and leaps over the Dragon Gate at the top of the Yellow River will transform into a golden dragon, symbolizing ambition, perseverance, and great achievement. This tale has made koi fish a powerful emblem of determination and success.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span>
                Avoid disturbing the water: Since koi ponds are meant to be tranquil spaces, sudden movements or loud noises can disrupt their peaceful environment. What they love: Quiet and peaceful pools with lotus are their favorite!
                Respect their ecosystem: Koi thrive in clean, well-maintained water with balanced plant life, especially lotus flowers, which help oxygenate the pond and provide shade.
